      <p>
        <em>I have been fascinated with computers since I was a child.
        My grandfather began to teach me how to use the computer when I was 5 years old and the Tandy computers had just come out on the market.
        After attending a technical college for IT, I decided that the tradional collegiate route was not for me.
        After a few other opportunities came and went, I reclaimed my desire to work with computers again and began anew.</em>
